# User Experience Designer Fundamentals: Session 1

[Download Keynote here](files/Session-1.pdf)

## Introduction and what we’re here

We asked the questions, Who are you?, What’s your background?, Why are you here?, What do you want to find out?

## History and background of UX

* Not always called UX.
* The term 'Interaction design' more common
* UX, user experience, tends to centre around the user
* Tends to be digital
* UX is made up of mostly three parts: UI (how most people get started), User Research and Information architecture
* As UXer’s gain experience they consider all parts e.g. sound

## Interaction vs User Experience

Interaction  

Experience



## Take Apple as an example..

Design is important…

Budget for design

But new products are always necessary

Diminishing returns...hard to keep growth…

N+1 problem

One technique is to buy other companies

Is this sustainable?


UX and design process before specification is important…

UX can be for anything…

Pick a specialism…


## UX research methods

### Observe

* It is most important to observe your subject
* Whether it is users, a process, or location, always try to observe
* Always try to see things as new


##### Dog camera

* The example of the dog camera was an experiential way to experience the project in a new and non biased way
* Good UX research techniques make you see things afresh and new



##### Existing behaviours

— E.g. how this elderly women is holding up a jug to see the measurements

Compensating behaviours

* Look out for ‘compensating behaviours’ 
* These are behaviours the users are already doing, but nothing has been designed for them yet
* Note the Nokia example : users sharing one phone in villages. The outcome is to have a shared contact list

##### User interviews

* User interviews are an effective UX research method
* Attract participants by offering money, Amazon vouchers and free beer
* I used to run these sessions every Thursday afternoon, and probably pre-prepare them on a regular basis


##### Gain empathy

* The best thing about user interviews is that you quickly gain empathy
* I would get them to use the product and write down any quotes, especially frustrations of using the product
* These quotes  + screenshots of the area, were a great way to communicate problems to engineers and the rest of the company


##### Research amnesty

* Hacking existing research


##### Jobs to be done introduction and exercise


## Which tool?

Designing is like surviving an emergency situation or winning a battle, it comes down to many issues e.g. Tools, training, characters.

* No ‘right’ combination of training or tools
* No ‘right’ method




## Coursework Task

* Pick a page online which involves an action
* Interview someone about it
* Redesign it

Come back with a redesign

Come back with thoughts about a specialism

#### Designers are decision makers

* Trained by eye
* Their experience
* Their taste
* Ability to see things differently

You should be always training yourself to get better at decisions.
