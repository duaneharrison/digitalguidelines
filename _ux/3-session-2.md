# User Experience Designer Fundamentals: Session 2

[Download Keynote here](files/Session-2.pdf)

Session begins with a review of the task from Session 1:

* What experience did you pick?
* What did the user say?
* What did you improve?
* How did you visualise it?
* What might you do better next time?

Reminder to question everything. — I encourage users to question everything

* I keep a book of questions about things to improve
* These can guide me, as I might right down problems I want to solve, and find related projects or companies

## Specialism

Quick recap to start thinking about a specialism in design.

## Day in the life of a UX designer…

### At Citymapper

* Conducting user interviews at Citymapper
* Worked on core Product/features
* Asset production

### Pie Mapping

* Site visits for research
* Wireframes (from business needs)
* Translate into UI

### Cathay Pacific

* Many meetings
* Style guide for Cathay Dragon
* A/B testing


## Crash course on UX/UI

UX Design Process, based mostly on IDEO (established design agency) who have revisited their design process. 


### 1. Observation

* It is most important to observe your subject
* Whether it is users, a process, or location, always try to observe
* Always try to see things as new

##### Look for existing or compensating behaviours
[Compensating behaviours linkedin article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/opportunities-innovation-already-jamie-sunderland?trk=v-feed&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_details_shares%3Bp02ttq0WMtook1INbNFkzA%3D%3D)

##### Gaining a different perspective

Try to gain as much of a different perspective as possible. An extreme example of this is the dog camera.

##### User interviews

* User interviews are an effective UX research method
* Attract participants by offering money, Amazon vouchers and free beer
* I used to run these sessions every Thursday afternoon, and probably pre-prepare them on a regular basis

##### Gain Empathy

* The best thing about user interviews is that you quickly gain empathy
* I would get them to use the product and write down any quotes, especially frustrations of using the product
* These quotes  + screenshots of the area, were a great way to communicate problems to engineers and the rest of the company

##### Observe the current market (secondary research)

### 2. Ideation

* Brainstorming
* Storyboard / journey mapping
* Business canvas

##### Brainstorming

Go for volume of ideas


##### Storyboarding

Sketch out the situation and the user journey by drawing out the process.


##### Consumer Journey Map
A diagram that explores the multiple (sometimes invisible) steps taken by consumers as they engage with the service. Allows designers to frame the consumer’s motivations and needs in each step of the journey, creating design solutions that are appropriate for each.

### 3. Rapid Prototyping

Prototyping to avoid expensive mistakes

##### Wireframing

### 4. User Feedback

User interviews can appear any stage of the process. It is most effective when you have a product or prototype you can test with real users.

##### User testing 
[User testing](http://uxmastery.com/learn-user-testing-in-10-minutes/)

##### Paper prototyping

##### Quick and free user testing

##### Personas/Perspectives

##### Card Sorting
A technique that consists in asking users to group content and functionalities into open or closed categories. Gives you input on content hierarchy, organization and flow.

[Card sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)



### 5. Iteration

Repart previous process, but improve the outcome.

Create a map to record the whole ‘experience’, and consider the following:

* Values
* User needs
* Actions
* Interface
* Technology


### 6. Implementation

* Consider real design (conversion, web accessibility, scalability, assets, production)

* User feedback and refine (get constant feedback, a/b testing).

* Create an implementation map for engineers. Map it out: Visualise, Map it all interactions

* Map out detail (if mobile app, individual taps, options, even sounds)

* The hardest part is putting your product out there - a real product. Market the product using real use case. Take good photography.


## Other tools / notes

IDEO Method cards - tools for process design. If you are ever stuck on a problem.
