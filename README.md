# Accelerate CMS
Accelerate CMS is generated by the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
The site is accessible in [http://cms.acceleratedhk.com/](http://cms.acceleratedhk.com/).
The course materials should be put in the folder respectively.)
As of time of writing, there are three courses in the CMS
* Data Science where folder name is "_data_science"
* Web Devs Fundamentals where folder name is "_web_dev_basic"
* User Experience where folder name is "_ux"

## Adding a new Page

To add a new page, you have to put a new markdown file(*.md or *.markdown) in the folder 
designated for the course materials. Starting with the first line of the file(**NO EMPTY Line**).
You have to input the meta data. Here is an example:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title:  "Getting Setup"
date:   2017-02-20 15:56:56 +0800
day: 1
categories: jekyll update
---
```
1. **layout** is mandatory. It is usually **page**.
2. **title** is the title shown at the top of the bar.
3. **date** is optional. 
4. **day**  is for grouping in listing. For example, all pages of *Day 1* will be grouped under the same tag.
5. **categories** is not used at this moment.


## Tools for editing the content.
### Directly editing in local machine
You can install Jekyll on your machine and run 
```bash
    jekyll serve
```
to serve content. After finishing the content, you can commit and push the content to [Github Accelerate CMS Repo](https://github.com/acceleratedhk/accelerate-cms)
You can try to use modern editors which have markdown preview to make you life easier.
I recommend [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
### Editing on prose.io
If you prefer web editor, you can try [prose.io](http://prose.io). You have to authorize the site to access your github repository before you are able to use it.

## Using Git
If you find it difficult to use git command line. You can try to use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you are using Windows or macOS. 
You can use [Git Cola](http://git-cola.github.io/) and [Gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg) on Ubuntu.
