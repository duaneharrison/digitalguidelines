# Visualisations Project

Before you start working on your project, I want to talk about some things to keep in mind.

## Datasets

You can of course choose any dataset you like, but before you start working on it, please make sure it is visualisable.

Go through the dataset in the software of your choice and make sure that:

a. There is enough data to ask questions and make visualisations

b. The data types can be visualised by you. Please don't take text or image data and try to visualise that for this project. You can attempt that for the final project if you really want.

**Data Sources**
1. [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com/datasets)

2. [KDNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html)

3. [Data.World](https://data.world/)

4. [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)

5. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/?_encoding=UTF8&jiveRedirect=1)

6. [Google Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/)

7. [Wikipedia Datasets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download)

8. [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/search)

9. [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/)

## Presentation

Here is a rough outline for the presentation that you should follow:

- Introduce yourself
- Talk about what has excited you most about Data Science so far
- Explain the dataset: Talk about where you got it from (not Kaggle, find the actual source), what it consists of, why you chose it, and how you manipulated it
- What you were trying to investigate/what questions you were trying to answer
- Report the answers you found, if any (this part will come with visualisations)
- Conclusion, and how you would continue the investigation if you had more time
- Q&A session for the people present

## Criteria

To give you feedback, I'll use the following criteria:

- Explanation of Dataset and its nuances (every dataset has some nuances)
- Python usage to prep for visualisations (from code)
- Quality of question asked given the dataset
- Python visualisations (not just complexity but appropriateness and presentation)
- Articulation of results in your presentation  
- Roadmap for the future if you had more time

## Important Thoughts

Given that this is a data science presentation, I want you to think back to the first class and remember that every data science project has to derive some value.

Remember to focus on answer a question from the dataset, and don't get lost in all the noise. You are supposed to extract insight from this dataset and not just make visualisations. The worst thing you can do is make random and complicated visualisations without a goal in mind or a story to tell.

Have fun!
